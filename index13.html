    <h1>Dicktown</h1>
    <p>Google users
        Richardsville, North Carolina (aka Dicktown to the locals) has famous boy detective, John Hunchman. Except John isn't a boy any more. He's a sad, shabby man who just turned 40, and while he's still a detective, he only solves crimes for teenagers with his partner, David Purefoy. David used to be John's arch-enemy in high school, but like John, he also failed to get out of town and still lives with his parents. David is John's driver, hired muscle and unlikely friend. Each week they take on a different client and solve a different mystery of Dicktown.</p>
